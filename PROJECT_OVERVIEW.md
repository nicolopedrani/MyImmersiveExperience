# MyImmersiveExperience - Interactive Portfolio

## 🎯 Project Purpose

**MyImmersiveExperience** is an innovative interactive portfolio designed specifically for recruiters and hiring managers. Instead of a traditional resume or portfolio website, this project presents personal information, skills, and experiences through an explorable 2D pixel-art game environment.

The goal is to create a memorable and engaging way for potential employers to discover my background, interests, and technical capabilities while showcasing my development skills through the interactive experience itself.

## 🎮 Game Overview

The experience is structured as a **room-based exploration game** where visitors can navigate through different areas, each representing a different aspect of my professional and personal profile:

### Room Structure
- **🏠 Central Hub (Main Room)** - Welcome area and navigation center
- **🎨 Hobbies Room** - Personal interests and activities (football, travel flags, etc.)
- **💼 Working Experience Room** - Professional background and career highlights *(in development)*
- **👑 Final Boss Room** - Special interactive challenge or showcase *(planned)*

### Current Status
- ✅ **Central Hub** - Completed with navigation paths
- ✅ **Hobbies Room** - Completed with football field and travel flags
- 🚧 **Working Experience Room** - In development
- 📋 **Final Boss Room** - Planned

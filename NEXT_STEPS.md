# MyImmersiveExperience - Next Steps Summary

## Current Status âœ…
The interactive portfolio game is nearly complete with all major rooms implemented:

### Completed Features:
- **Central Hub**: Navigation center with doors to all rooms
- **Work Experience Room**: Split layout with Data Science (left) and R&D System Engineer (right) experiences
- **Hobbies Room**: Reading, Football, and Travel sections with unique country flags
- **Boss Room Structure**: Natural environment with MainGuy character, flowers, and straight path

### Boss Room Current State:
- âœ… Natural grass environment (non-walkable grass tiles)
- âœ… MainGuy character sprite extracted from MainGuySpriteSheet.png (centered at x=5)
- âœ… Decorative flower tiles with grass backgrounds
- âœ… Straight walkable path from entrance to boss character
- âœ… Proper asset loading and rendering system

## Next Priority: Boss Interaction System ðŸŽ¯

### Immediate Tasks (High Priority):

#### 1. Fix NPM Installation Issue
```bash
# Current issue: npm cache permission errors
# Solutions to try:
npm cache clean --force
# OR
sudo npm install @xenova/transformers
# OR
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install
```

#### 2. Install and Configure Transformers.js
- **Package**: `@xenova/transformers@^2.17.2` (already added to package.json)
- **Purpose**: Browser-based AI for CV question answering
- **Compatibility**: Confirmed to work with GitHub Pages deployment

#### 3. Create Boss Interaction Detection System
**File to create**: `src/modules/bossInteraction.ts`
```typescript
// Key functions needed:
- detectBossProximity(playerX, playerY): boolean
- showInteractionPrompt(): void
- startConversation(): void
- endConversation(): void
```

#### 4. Implement Conversation UI Overlay
**Features needed**:
- Modal dialog overlay for conversations
- Chat-style interface (user input + AI response)
- Professional styling matching the game's aesthetic
- Close/escape functionality

#### 5. Set Up CV Document Processing
**Files involved**:
- `assets/CV_Pedrani.pdf` (already exists)
- Create CV text extraction and chunking system
- Implement basic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for context

### Technical Implementation Plan:

#### Phase 1: Basic Interaction (1-2 hours)
1. **Proximity Detection**:
   ```typescript
   // In roomManager.ts or new bossInteraction.ts
   function checkBossInteraction(): boolean {
     const currentRoom = getCurrentRoom();
     if (currentRoom.id === "room2") {
       const distance = Math.abs(player.x - 5) + Math.abs(player.y - 1);
       return distance <= 1; // Adjacent to boss
     }
     return false;
   }
   ```

2. **Interaction Trigger**:
   - Add SPACE key handler when near boss
   - Show "Press SPACE to talk" prompt
   - Open conversation modal

#### Phase 2: Conversation Interface (2-3 hours)
1. **Create Conversation Module**:
   ```typescript
   // src/modules/conversation.ts
   export class ConversationSystem {
     private isActive: boolean = false;
     private conversationHistory: {user: string, ai: string}[] = [];
     
     showConversationUI(): void { /* Create modal overlay */ }
     processUserInput(input: string): Promise<string> { /* AI processing */ }
     closeConversation(): void { /* Cleanup and close */ }
   }
   ```

2. **UI Components**:
   - Modal backdrop (semi-transparent)
   - Chat container with scrollable history
   - Input field for user questions
   - Send button and keyboard shortcuts
   - Professional styling with CSS

#### Phase 3: AI Integration (2-4 hours)
1. **Initialize Transformers.js**:
   ```typescript
   import { pipeline } from '@xenova/transformers';
   
   // Use a lightweight Q&A model
   const qa = await pipeline('question-answering', 'Xenova/distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad');
   ```

2. **CV Context Preparation**:
   - Extract text from CV_Pedrani.pdf
   - Split into chunks for efficient processing
   - Create context database for RAG

3. **Question Processing**:
   ```typescript
   async function answerQuestion(question: string): Promise<string> {
     // Use RAG to find relevant CV sections
     const context = findRelevantContext(question);
     // Process with Q&A model
     const answer = await qa({ question, context });
     return answer.answer;
   }
   ```

### Key Files to Modify/Create:

#### New Files:
- `src/modules/bossInteraction.ts` - Main interaction logic
- `src/modules/conversation.ts` - Conversation system
- `src/modules/aiProcessor.ts` - Transformers.js integration
- `src/styles/conversation.css` - Conversation UI styling

#### Files to Modify:
- `src/modules/input.ts` - Add boss interaction key handlers
- `src/modules/roomManager.ts` - Add boss proximity detection
- `src/main.ts` - Integrate conversation system
- `index.html` - Add conversation CSS import

### Configuration Notes:

#### Vite Configuration for Transformers.js:
```javascript
// vite.config.js may need updates for WASM support
export default {
  optimizeDeps: {
    include: ['@xenova/transformers']
  }
}
```

#### Model Selection:
- **Recommended**: `Xenova/distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad` (lightweight, good for Q&A)
- **Alternative**: `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (for semantic similarity)
- **Size consideration**: Models are ~50-100MB, acceptable for GitHub Pages

### Expected User Experience:
1. Player approaches MainGuy character in boss room
2. "Press SPACE to talk to Nicolo" prompt appears
3. Conversation modal opens with professional interface
4. User can ask questions about CV/experience
5. AI provides contextual answers based on CV content
6. Conversation history is maintained during session
7. Player can close conversation and resume game

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Boss proximity detection works correctly
- [ ] Conversation UI opens/closes properly
- [ ] Transformers.js loads without errors
- [ ] CV context is properly processed
- [ ] AI responses are relevant and accurate
- [ ] UI is responsive and professionally styled
- [ ] Works on both desktop and mobile
- [ ] Compatible with GitHub Pages deployment

### Current Repository State:
- **Branch**: `development`
- **Last Commit**: "Implement complete boss room with natural environment and MainGuy character"
- **Status**: Clean working tree, ready for boss interaction development

### Estimated Time to Completion:
- **Basic interaction**: 1-2 hours
- **Full conversation system**: 4-8 hours total
- **Polish and testing**: 1-2 hours

### Dependencies Status:
- `@xenova/transformers@^2.17.2` added to package.json but not installed due to npm cache issues
- Need to resolve npm installation before proceeding

## Context for New Session:
This is an interactive portfolio game built with TypeScript, HTML5 Canvas, and Vite. The user (Nicolo Pedrani) wants recruiters to explore his professional background through an engaging game experience. The final boss room is complete structurally, but needs the AI-powered conversation system to allow visitors to ask questions about his CV and experience.

**Key Technical Stack**: TypeScript, Canvas API, Vite, Transformers.js, GitHub Pages deployment
**Current Focus**: Implementing CV-based Q&A system using browser-based AI
**User Requirements**: Professional, recruiter-friendly, AI-powered conversation about CV content
